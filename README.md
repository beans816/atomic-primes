# Sieve of Eratosthenes

Common Lisp predicate of a prime number using the ancient algorithm of the Sieve of Eratosthenes. 
If you cannot define a prime through a sequence, you define a prime number by the number of its prime factors.

-> Primes don't occur in a sequence that I know of. They are found using Eratosthenes algorithm.

# Goldbach's conjecture

Frome wikipedia: 'Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics. It states that every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.'

-> Sequences.lisp aims to eventually solve Goldbachs Conjecture by proving that Goldbachs comet occurs in a sequence or algorithm that can be computed. If something can be computed with a algorithm, it's a proof. Just by looking at the picture below, its quite clear that there is a pattern/sequence and that it's impossible for Goldbachs Conjecture to be incorrect.

Goldbach's comet also shows an obvious pattern that looks like the upper right side of a hyperbola. This means that the sums of primes can be predicted!
