# PrimeP

Common Lisp predicate of a prime number using the ancient algorithm of the Sieve of Eratosthenes. 
If you cannot define a prime through a sequence, you define a prime number by saying it by saying what it is not.

This algorithm checks to see if the given number is a prime number or if it is not.
The Sieve of Eratosthenes returns the 'random' sequence of prime numbers up to to a given number through the same method I have shown you.
